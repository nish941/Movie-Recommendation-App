# Movie-Recommendation-App

Creating a 3D frontend for your Movie Recommendation System can significantly enhance user engagement and provide a unique experience. Below is a detailed roadmap that outlines the project structure. This roadmap will guide you through the development process step by step.
Detailed Roadmap for 3D Movie Recommendation System

1. Project Overview

Objective: Build an interactive 3D Movie Recommendation System that fetches real-time movie data, conducts user surveys, and tracks user preferences.
Technology Stack:

Frontend: Angular with Three.js for 3D rendering.
Backend: Flask for the API.
Database: PostgreSQL for storing user data, movie data, and reviews.
External Movie API: TMDb API for fetching real-time movie data.
Deployment: AWS for hosting (Lambda, RDS, S3).

assets/: Directory for static assets like 3D models and images.


4. Detailed Steps for Implementation
Step 1: Set Up the Environment
Create a new Angular project for the frontend.
Set up a Flask project for the backend.
Create a PostgreSQL database.

Step 2: User Authentication
Implement user registration and login functionality in the backend.
Create the user service in Angular to handle authentication.

Step 3: Movie Survey
Create a survey component to collect user preferences.
Design the survey form to ask users for their top 10 favorite movies.

Step 4: Fetch Movies from External API
Use the TMDb API to fetch movie data based on user preferences.
Create a service in Angular to handle API calls.

Step 5: Store User Preferences and Reviews
Create database models for users, movies, and reviews in the backend.
Implement API endpoints to save user preferences and reviews.

Step 6: Recommendation Logic
Implement logic in the backend to analyze user preferences and suggest movies.
Use machine learning techniques if necessary to improve recommendations.

Step 7: 3D Rendering with Three.js
Integrate Three.js into the Angular project.
Create a 3D view component to render movies in a 3D space.
Load 3D models or images of movies and display them interactively.

Step 8: Interactive UI
Design an engaging user interface using Angular and Bootstrap.
Ensure the UI is responsive and user-friendly.

Step 9: Deployment
Deploy the backend to AWS Lambda and the frontend to S3.
Set up API Gateway to route requests to your Flask backend.

5. Additional Considerations
Testing: Implement unit tests for both frontend and backend components.
Monitoring: Set up monitoring for your AWS services using CloudWatch.
Security: Implement security best practices, including HTTPS and user authentication.
